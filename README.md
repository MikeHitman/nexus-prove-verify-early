## Describe 
I'm the primary coder who selects projects and deploys smart contracts, nodes, and validators. If you're interested in interacting with the project with a couple of clicks, you're welcome. There is also an opportunity to get a non-guaranteed airdrop, if you are interested follow me here: [@NoworkNoresult](https://x.com/NoworkNoresult). The idea was taken from [x.com](@ZunXBT), thanks for the inspiration

## Troubleshooting
If you face any problem just delete existing workspace and again use the above command on fresh blank workspace
